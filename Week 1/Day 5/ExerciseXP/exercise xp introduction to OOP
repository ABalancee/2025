#Exercise 2 : Dogs
#Instructions
#Create a class called Dog.
#In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
#Create a method called bark that prints the following string “<dog_name> goes woof!”.
#Create a method called jump that prints the following string “<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!”. x is the height*2.
#Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog’s name is “Rex” and his height is 50cm.
#Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
#Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog’s name is “Teacup” and his height is 20cm.
#Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
#Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.

    def __init__(self, name, height):
        self.name = name

    def jump(self):
        print(f'{self.name} jumps {self.height * 2} cm high !')

davids_dog = Dog("Rex", 50)
print(f"{davids_dog.name} is {davids_dog.height} cm high.")
